This repo contains tasks related to data science, conducted when I was pursuing the introduction to data science course at Lodz University of technology in the year 10.2020. It consists of three laboratory tasks as follows:- (The projects are implemented using python language)

## TASK01 - Introduction and EDA¶
Several of your friends live in Poland and are offered jobs at a US company with many locations all across the country. The job offers are great but news with headlines such as “America is one of 6 countries that make up more than half of guns deaths worldwide” have them worried. Charts like this make them worry even more:

You want to convince your friends that the US is a large and diverse country with 50 very different states as well as the District of Columbia (DC). Use data from the US gun violence dataset.

Problems and Questions:

1) What is the state with the most murders? Would you say this is the most dangerous state? Hint: Make a plot showing the relationship between population size (search for current data) and number of murders.

2) Create new csv dataset with the following structure:

a) Column 1: state

b) Column 2: population

c) Column 3: murders_total

d) Column 4: murder_rate

3) Describe the distribution of murder rates across states. How similar are states? How much do murder rates vary by geographical regions? Provide conclusions and recommendations for your friends.
