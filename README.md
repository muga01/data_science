This repo contains tasks related to data science, conducted when I was pursuing the introduction to data science course at Lodz University of Technology for the year 2020. It consists of four selected tasks as follows:- (The projects are implemented using python language)

## Lab01 - Introduction and EDA¶
Several of your friends live in Poland and are offered jobs at a US company with many locations all across the country. The job offers are great but news with headlines such as “America is one of 6 countries that make up more than half of guns deaths worldwide” have them worried. Charts like this make them worry even more:

You want to convince your friends that the US is a large and diverse country with 50 very different states as well as the District of Columbia (DC). Use data from the US gun violence dataset.

Problems and Questions:

1) What is the state with the most murders? Would you say this is the most dangerous state? Hint: Make a plot showing the relationship between population size (search for current data) and number of murders.

2) Create new csv dataset with the following structure:

    a) Column 1: state

    b) Column 2: population

    c) Column 3: murders_total

    d) Column 4: murder_rate

3) Describe the distribution of murder rates across states. How similar are states? How much do murder rates vary by geographical regions? Provide conclusions and recommendations for your friends.

## Lab02 - Positive impacts of vaccines in public health
Vaccines have helped save millions of lives. In the 19th century, before herd immunization was achieved through vaccination programs, deaths from infectious diseases, like smallpox and polio, were common. However, today, despite all the scientific evidence for their importance, vaccination programs have become somewhat controversial.

The controversy started with a paper published in 1988 and lead by Andrew Wakefield (Wakefield, Andrew J., et al. "RETRACTED: Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children." The Lancet (1998): 637-641) claiming there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the appearance of autism and bowel disease. Despite much science contradicting this finding, sensationalists media reports and fear mongering from conspiracy theorists, led parts of the public to believe that vaccines were harmful. Some parents stopped vaccinating their children. This dangerous practice can be potentially disastrous given that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years (see: Benefits from Immunization during the Vaccines for Children Program Era — United States, 1994-2013, MMWR).

Effective communication of data is a strong antidote to misinformation and fear mongering. **Prepare a report to have ready in case you need to help a family member, friend or acquaintance that is not aware of the positive impact vaccines have had for public health.**

The data used for these plots were collected, organized and distributed by the Tycho Project. They include weekly reported counts data for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty US states.

## Lab03 - Data wrangling
The United States Social Security Administration releases data dating back to 1880 on babies’ first names, genders, and their popularity (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control releases data on life expectancy in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/life_tables.htm). The data is used to depict trends on baby names, number of births and among other tasks. Charts are included as well

## Mammogram - predict whether a mammogram mass is a benign or malignant
In this project we aim at finding the model which will accurately predict whether a mammogram mass is a benign or malignant. The aim is to assist doctors to correctly interpret the mammogram results inorder to avoid wrong breast surgeries. In the whole process we will use python libraries such as scikit to achieve the goal. We start with dataset download, pre-processing them, Training the data through different machine learning and Neural networks models and hence conclusion. Comments are provided in each section of the code block for the clear understanding of the codes. We use a public dataset available here(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)
